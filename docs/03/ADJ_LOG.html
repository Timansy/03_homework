<h1 id="javascript-password-generator">03 JavaScript: Password Generator</h1>
<p>This week, we took some existing structure and added a password creation function that followed some basic rules.</p>
<h2 id="review">Review</h2>
<p>In order to meet the requirements, I did the following.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Get the length the customer wants their password to be: To do this, I provided a prompt that grabs some input and then used the isNaN function to validate.</p></li>
<li><p>Allow the user to select the character types to include: Here I iterated through the types available and then tested for at least one selection.</p></li>
<li><p>Supply a pw that has at least one of each element: Here i looped through and randomly selected 1 character from each character set and added it to the the existing string until the length requirement was met. I then returned a substring that contained the just the needed size (in case the looping provided more than needed).</p></li>
</ol>
